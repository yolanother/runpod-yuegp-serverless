üöÄ | A simple worker that can be used as a starting point to build your own custom RunPod Endpoint API worker.
</div>

## üìñ | Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. (Optional) Add DockerHub credentials to GitHub Secrets.
3. Add your code to the `src` directory.
4. Update the `handler.py` file to load models and process requests.
5. Add any dependencies to the `requirements.txt` file.
6. Add any other build time scripts to the`builder` directory, for example, downloading models.
7. Update the `Dockerfile` to include any additional dependencies.
8. Replace the template `worker-config.json` file with your own (the template one is an example from our [vLLM worker](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-vllm)).

### üîß | Worker Config

The `worker-config.json` is a JSON file that is used to build the form that helps users configure their serverless endpoint on the RunPod Web Interface.

Note: This is a new feature and only works for workers that use one model 

<details>
<summary>Writing your worker-config.json</summary>

The JSON consists of two main parts, schema and versions.
- `schema`: Here you specify the form fields that will be displayed to the user.
  - `env_var_name`: The name of the environment variable that is being set using the form field.
  - `value`: This is the default value of the form field. It will be shown in the UI as such unless the user changes it.
  - `title`: This is the title of the form field in the UI.
  - `description`: This is the description of the form field in the UI.
  - `required`: This is a boolean that specifies if the form field is required.
  - `type`: This is the type of the form field. Options are:
    - `text`: Environment variable is a string so user inputs text in form field.
    - `select`: User selects one option from the dropdown. You must provide the `options` key value pair after type if using this.
    - `toggle`: User toggles between true and false.
    - `number`: User inputs a number in the form field.
  - `options`: Specify the options the user can select from if the type is `select`. DO NOT include this unless the `type` is `select`.
- `versions`: This is where you call the form fields specified in `schema` and organize them into categories.
  - `imageName`: This is the name of the Docker image that will be used to run the serverless endpoint.
  - `minimumCudaVersion`: This is the minimum CUDA version that is required to run the serverless endpoint.
  - `categories`: This is where you call the keys of the form fields specified in `schema` and organize them into categories. Each category is a toggle list of forms on the Web UI.
    - `title`: This is the title of the category in the UI.
    - `settings`: This is the array of settings schemas specified in `schema` associated with the category.

### ‚öôÔ∏è | CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

As a reference this repository provides example CI/CD workflows to help you test your worker and build a docker image. The three main workflows are:

1. `CI-test_handler.yml` - Tests the handler using the input provided by the `--test_input` argument when calling the file containing your handler.

### Test Handler

This workflow will validate that your handler works as expected. You may need to add some dependency installations to the `CI-test_handler.yml` file to ensure your handler can be tested.

The action expects the following arguments to be available:

- `vars.RUNNER_24GB` | The endpoint ID on RunPod for a 24GB runner.
- `secrets.RUNPOD_API_KEY` | Your RunPod API key.
- `secrets.GH_PAT` | Your GitHub Personal Access Token.
- `vars.GH_ORG` | The GitHub organization that owns the repository, this is where the runner will be added to.

### Test End-to-End

This repository is setup to automatically build and push a docker image to the GitHub Container Registry. You will need to add the following to the GitHub Secrets for this repository to enable this functionality:

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Your DockerHub username for logging in.
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | Your DockerHub token for logging in.

Additionally, the following need to be added as GitHub actions variables:

- `DOCKERHUB_REPO` | The name of the repository you want to push to.
- `DOCKERHUB_IMG` | The name of the image you want to push to.

The `CD-docker_dev.yml` file will build the image and push it to the `dev` tag, while the `CD-docker_release.yml` file will build the image on releases and tag it with the release version.

The `CI-test_worker.yml` file will test the worker using the input provided by the `--test_input` argument when calling the file containing your handler. Be sure to update this workflow to install any dependencies you need to run your tests.

## Example Input

```json
{
    "input": {
        "name": "John Doe"
    }
}
```

## üí° | Best Practices

System dependency installation, model caching, and other shell tasks should be added to the `builder/setup.sh` this will allow you to easily setup your Dockerfile as well as run CI/CD tasks.

Models should be part of your docker image, this can be accomplished by either copying them into the image or downloading them during the build process.

If using the input validation utility from the runpod python package, create a `schemas` python file where you can define the schemas, then import that file into your `handler.py` file.
